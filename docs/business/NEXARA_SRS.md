## 5. Key Use Cases

**UC-01:** Client hires Concierge → passes payment → agent activates → handles WhatsApp leads autonomously within minutes.

**UC-02:** Agent tries illegal action → Inspector blocks it → audit logged → client + admin notified in real-time.

**UC-03:** Hacking attempt detected → Rex + Inspector alert dev team via Slack/PagerDuty within 60 seconds → endpoint auto-blocked via Cloudflare API.

**UC-04:** Client loses phone → logs into console → revokes all sessions → re-enables MFA with backup codes.

---

## 6. System Constraints
- Infrastructure budget Phase 0–1: **< $100/month**
- AI provider must be **swappable with 1 env variable**
- No always-on servers except Inspector (Cloud Run min-instances=1)
- No Redis or message queue until 200+ clients (use diskcache + apscheduler)
