## Philosophy: Zero Manual Work

```
Traditional SaaS company (10 clients):
  ├── 1 support person manually answers questions
  ├── 1 finance person manually chases invoices
  ├── 1 admin manually onboards clients
  └── 1 dev manually monitors servers

Nexara (1,000 clients):
  ├── Shield + Concierge handle all support automatically
  ├── Finn auto-generates and auto-chases all invoices
  ├── Veritas + AI Configurator onboards all clients automatically
  └── Rex + Kai monitor and self-heal all servers automatically
  └── Human involvement: ZERO for routine operations

## Automated Billing & Payments

### Subscription Lifecycle (Fully Automated)

```
Client signs up
      │
      ▼
Free Intern tier (30 days) activated automatically
Finn schedules reminder at Day 20, 25, 29
      │
      ▼
Day 30: Auto-upgrade prompt
Client selects plan + saves payment method
      │
      ├── Bangladesh: bKash auto-debit token saved
      ├── Global: Stripe payment method saved
      ├── India: Razorpay mandate created
      │
      ▼
Every billing cycle (monthly/annual):
Finn triggers auto-charge → success/fail
      │
      ├── SUCCESS:
      │   • Receipt generated automatically
      │   • Invoice PDF sent via Iris (email)
      │   • WhatsApp confirmation via Concierge
      │   • Tier stays active
      │
      └── FAILURE:
          • Retry after 24 hours (3 attempts)
          • Dunning emails sent by Iris (Day 1, 3, 7)
          • Grace period: 7 days (agents stay active)
          • Day 8: Agents paused (not deleted)
          • Day 30: Data archived, account suspended
          • Client can reactivate anytime (data preserved 90 days)
```

### Auto-Payment Code Architecture
```python
class BillingAutomation:
    """Finn handles all billing. No human needed."""

    @celery_task(schedule="0 0 * * *")  # Runs every midnight
    def process_daily_billing(self):
        """Auto-charge all subscriptions due today"""
        due_today = Subscription.objects.filter(
            next_billing_date=today(),
            status="ACTIVE"
        )
        for sub in due_today:
            self.charge(sub)

    def charge(self, subscription: Subscription):
        gateway = PaymentRouter.get_gateway(subscription.client)
        result = gateway.charge(
            amount=subscription.amount,
            currency=subscription.currency,
            payment_method=subscription.saved_payment_method
        )
        if result.success:
            self.on_payment_success(subscription, result)
        else:
            self.on_payment_failure(subscription, result)

    def on_payment_success(self, sub, result):
        Invoice.auto_generate(sub, result.transaction_id)  # Finn
        Iris.send_receipt_email(sub.client)
        Concierge.send_whatsapp_confirmation(sub.client)
        sub.extend_period()

    def on_payment_failure(self, sub, result):
        DunningManager.start_sequence(sub, failure_reason=result.error)
        Rex.log_payment_anomaly(sub.client, result)  # security audit
```
