## Concept: Zero-Config Onboarding

When a client signs up, instead of a blank dashboard —
**AI interviews them and builds their perfect workspace in 3 minutes.**

```
Step 1: Client passes KYB (Veritas)
Step 2: AI asks 6 questions about their business
Step 3: AI configures their entire dashboard, agents, and payment
Step 4: Client arrives at a dashboard that feels like it was built for them
Step 5: Client can modify anything by just asking the AI
```

## AI Dashboard Modifier ("Change Anything by Asking")

After setup, clients can modify their dashboard by just asking:

```
Client types: "Move my analytics chart to the top"
→ AI updates dashboard layout JSON
→ Inspector checks (layout change = no compliance concern)
→ Dashboard refreshes instantly

Client types: "I want my dashboard to look more professional, use dark blue"
→ AI updates theme_primary_color to #1E3A5F
→ Regenerates CSS tokens for client's workspace
→ Applied instantly

Client types: "Add a widget for today's WhatsApp messages"
→ AI adds WhatsApp message count widget
→ If Concierge active: widget shows real data
→ If not hired: widget shows "Hire Concierge" CTA

Client types: "Remove the social media section, I don't need it"
→ AI hides Serea-related widgets
→ Dashboard reorganises automatically
```

```python
class DashboardAIModifier:
    """
    Client asks AI to change their dashboard in natural language
    All changes validated by Inspector before applying
    """

    ALLOWED_MODIFICATIONS = [
        "widget_order", "theme_color", "language",
        "notification_settings", "agent_config",
        "dashboard_layout", "hide_widget", "show_widget",
        "rename_workspace", "update_timezone"
    ]

    def modify(self, client_id: str, natural_language_request: str):
        # 1. AI interprets the request
        modification = AIEngine.parse_modification(
            request=natural_language_request,
            current_config=self.get_config(client_id),
            allowed_modifications=self.ALLOWED_MODIFICATIONS
        )

        # 2. Inspector validates (within SRS boundaries)
        result = Inspector.evaluate(
            action=modification,
            client_id=client_id
        )

        if result.approved:
            self.apply_modification(client_id, modification)
            self.notify_user("Dashboard updated ✅", client_id)
        else:
            self.notify_user(
                f"Cannot apply: {result.reason}. "
                f"Here's what you can do instead: {result.alternative}",
                client_id
            )
```

## Payment Flow (Integrated in Dashboard)

```
Client on dashboard → sees "Upgrade to Mid tier"
      │
      ▼
One-click payment sheet slides up (bottom sheet on mobile)
      │
      ├── Bangladesh: [bKash] [Nagad] [Card]
      ├── India: [UPI] [Cards] [Net Banking]
      ├── UAE: [Card] [Apple Pay]
      ├── Global: [Card] [Crypto] [PayPal]
      │
Client selects method → pays → tier activated instantly
      │
      ▼
Dashboard refreshes → new agents unlocked
Finn auto-generates invoice → Iris emails to client
```

---

## Per-Client Customisation Boundaries (SRS Guardrails)

Clients CAN change:
- ✅ Dashboard layout and widget order
- ✅ Theme colour (from approved palette)
- ✅ Language and timezone
- ✅ Agent configuration and knowledge base
- ✅ Notification preferences
- ✅ Team member roles and permissions
- ✅ Payment methods and billing details

Clients CANNOT change (Inspector enforces):
- ❌ Data retention policies (set by law/Nexara TOS)
- ❌ Compliance rules (Inspector is immutable)
- ❌ Audit log contents (append-only, immutable)
- ❌ Access to other clients' data (row-level security)
- ❌ AI model used (Nexara controls this, not clients)
- ❌ Inspector gate bypass (no override possible)
